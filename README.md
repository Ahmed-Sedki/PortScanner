# 🔍 **Port Scanner - Unveiling the Open Doors**

This Python-based tool allows you to probe the digital doors, aka ports, on a given IP address. Using the `socket` library, our Port Scanner peels back the layers to provide insight into which ports are open and waiting for connections.


## 🚀 **Getting Started**

Our Port Scanner is efficient and straightforward to use, requiring only Python 3. No additional Python packages are necessary, making the setup process quick and simple.

### 📋 **Prerequisites**

Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 🔧 **Installation & Usage**

1. Download the script or clone the repository.
2. Open your terminal/command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `port_scanner.py`.
4. Run the script using Python:

   ```shell
   python port_scanner.py
   ```

The script will prompt you for target IP addresses:

```shell
[*] Enter Target/s You To Scan(separate them by , ):
```

You can input a single IP address or multiple IP addresses separated by commas.

Next, specify how many ports you wish to scan:

```shell
[*] Enter How Many Ports You Want To Scan:
```

After receiving your input, our Port Scanner will start its journey, unveiling any open ports in the range you've specified:

```shell
Starting Scan For [target IP address]
Port :  [port number] is OPEN
```

## 📜 **Disclaimer**

Port scanning should be conducted responsibly. Always ensure you have explicit permission to probe and test the specified systems. Unauthorized port scanning can lead to legal repercussions and is generally regarded as unethical activity. By using this script, you agree to use it responsibly and ethically.
